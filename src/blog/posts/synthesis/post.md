Every time you communicate an idea, you are engaging in stakeholder management.
Stakeholder management is the process of making sure those with a vested
interest in your work know what to expect. The method I use for managing
expectations is something I refer to as _The Synthesis Step_, or _don't make
your stakeholders do the hard work of figuring out what you are trying to tell
them_.

### Synthesize

The more work you do as a writer, the more effectively you can control what
you'd like readers to take away from your writing. Usually this involves saying
more than the _what_ and moving toward a set of higher-level take-aways.

It is not enough to write code or go to meetings or read emails or send notes.
True value comes from being able to tell stakeholders a story about why these
things are important.

To use myself as an example, at work I subscribe to 51 email groups and 64 Slack
channels. Information triage is an important part of my workflow. Dumping raw
meeting notes to a list that are only consumable by the notetaker is not
valuable for me. The decision to send the notes to a list implies communication
with stakeholders. Tell me what you want me to know; don't make me figure it out
for myself.

### From 'what' to ...

Each set of stakeholders has different interests and needs. Those meeting notes
might be from a meeting between engineering and design about exposing new
payouts settings in the Stripe Dashboard.

- The project lead and _some_ of the engineering team need to know about the
  implementation choices made in this meeting. These should end up as Jira
  tickets.
- The engineering team and the design team care about the _outcome_ of the
  meeting: what was agreed upon, who is doing what, how the work will be
  scheduled. These should end up on an email sent to both teams.
- The company does not care about progress on the implementation; they only care
  when the project ships. The company should receive no communication.

This is a lot of work, but project leads that target stakeholders with relevant
updates provide a lot of value. Project leads are integration points that do
fan-in/fan-out between the project team and external stakeholders.
