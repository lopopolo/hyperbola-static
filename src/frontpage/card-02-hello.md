## ðŸ‘‹ Hello

Hi. I'm a software engineer working at Stripe in Seattle. I am a generalist with
experience building APIs, mobile SDKs, backend services, ETLs, infrastructure
automation, and other prod-infra shaped systems.

My favorite programming languages are Ruby and Rust, but I love to write glue
code and scripts in Python. Terraform and AWS are lots of fun, but it is better
to not maintain infrastructure if I don't have to.

I love sneakers, going on short hikes with my wife, and discovering new music.
