## oh hai!

I'm a software engineer working at Stripe in Seattle. I am a generalist with
experience building APIs, mobile SDKs, backend services, ETLs, and
infrastructure automation.

I am a git fanboy. I think I like Ruby better than Python nowadays; but I prefer
Django to Rails. Scala is slowly seducing me and Golang is giving me goosebumps.
Terraform and AWS were my new toys until I realized it is better to not maintain
infrastructure if you don't have to. Rust is my current favorite language.

ESPN is my favorite news source. I love sneakers and discovering new music.
