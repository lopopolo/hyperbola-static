They show how your organization plans and makes technical decisions. Let&#39;s walk through some scenarios and see what they imply about your org structure.</p><h3 id="99-aws-problems">99 AWS Problems</h3><p>You have 57 RDS instances, each with a different combination of instance type, EBS volume type, and database engine. Technical decision-making is decentralized.</p><p>Your entire EC2 fleet is comprised of six instance <em>types</em>. Capacity planning is centrally-managed, as is cloud orchestration.</p><p>Half of your Elasticsearch clusters are <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/">AWS-managed</a>; the other half run on self-managed EC2 instances. There is misalignment between two (or more) teams. Cost is not consistently considered when making architectural decisions, which means that engineering is misaligned with finance.</p><p>You buy <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/">reserved instances for EC2</a> but not <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/pricing/#Heavy_Utilization_Reserved_Nodes">ElastiCache</a>. Missing payment options and offering classes on ElastiCache RIs prevent you from applying your EC2 RI purchasing rules. Your biggest ElastiCache spender does not discuss this with finance, indicating a missing escalation path.</p><p>You keep submitting service limit increases for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html#vpc-limits-peering">VPC peering limits</a>. Engineering teams think they are building isolated infrastructure, but changing requirements break these assumptions. There is not enough global coordination during medium-term planning cycles.</p><p>One of your workloads upgrades from <code>c3</code>s to <code>c5d</code>s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/05/introducing-amazon-ec2-c5d-instances/">the day they are released</a>; another similar workload does not. Teams operate in silos. Technology news relevant to development propagates haphazardly.</p><p>You purchase hundreds of reserved instances every month. You have a team dedicated to <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/aws-reserved-instances">globally-optimizing AWS costs</a>.</p><h3 id="conways-law">Conway&#39;s Law</h3><p>Fixing the misalignments in these case studies requires increased communication.</p><p>Within engineering, 1:1s across team boundaries can be an effective way of socializing information. Working groups for teams that have similar workloads or infrastructure needs can align folks on consistent techniques.</p><p>The <a href="https://hyperbo.la/w/engineering-finance-partnership/">misalignments between engineering and finance</a> in the case studies span department boundaries. To correct these, designate a single point of contact (person or team) from each department. The points are responsible for communicating each other&#39;s requirements across the department boundary. Having a single directly responsible individual (DRI) within a department makes it easy to determine accountability.</p><h3 id="many-problems-many-dris">Many Problems, Many DRIs</h3><p>Core to the dysfunction in the above case studies is the tension between centralized and decentralized decision-making. I think the correct way to strike a balance is to identify the areas you care about and assign a single DRI for each. This allows you to centralize individual projects as well as avoid single points of failure.</p><p>If you want to change your story around Elasticsearch, cost optimization, and cross-team planning, assign a single person responsibility and imbue them with the authority to make changes. It helps if these DRIs align with team responsibilities so they may enlist additional resources if required.</p><p>We use this model at <a href="https://stripe.com/jobs">Stripe</a>. The Search Infrastructure team is consolidating our Elasticsearch infrastructure, the Insight team drives our cost optimization strategy and reserved instance purchasing, and the TPM org drives org-wide planning. Each team has consistently improved how we execute on the area for which they are responsible because they are empowered to do so.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src="/main.00ab8c3169de0b9be2bb.js"></script></body></html>
