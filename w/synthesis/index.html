Stakeholder management is the process of making sure those with a vested interest in your work know what to expect. The method I use for managing expectations is something I refer to as <em>The Synthesis Step</em>, or <em>don&#39;t make your stakeholders do the hard work of figuring out what you are trying to tell them</em>.</p><h3 id="synthesize">Synthesize</h3><p>The more work you do as a writer, the more effectively you can control what you&#39;d like readers to take away from your writing. Usually this involves saying more than the <em>what</em> and moving toward a set of higher-level take-aways.</p><p>It is not enough to write code or go to meetings or read emails or send notes. True value comes from being able to tell stakeholders a story about why these things are important.</p><p>To use myself as an example, at work I subscribe to 51 email groups and 64 Slack channels. Information triage is an important part of my workflow. Dumping raw meeting notes to a list that are only consumable by the notetaker is not valuable for me. The decision to send the notes to a list implies communication with stakeholders. Tell me what you want me to know; don&#39;t make me figure it out for myself.</p><h3 id="from-what-to-">From &#39;what&#39; to ...</h3><p>Each set of stakeholders has different interests and needs. Those meeting notes might be from a meeting between engineering and design about exposing new payouts settings in the Stripe Dashboard.</p><ul><li>The project lead and <em>some</em> of the engineering team need to know about the implementation choices made in this meeting. These should end up as Jira tickets.</li><li>The engineering team and the design team care about the <em>outcome</em> of the meeting: what was agreed upon, who is doing what, how the work will be scheduled. These should end up on an email sent to both teams.</li><li>The company does not care about progress on the implementation; they only care when the project ships. The company should receive no communication.</li></ul><p>This is a lot of work, but project leads that target stakeholders with relevant updates provide a lot of value. Project leads are integration points that do fan-in/fan-out between the project team and external stakeholders.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src="/main.00ab8c3169de0b9be2bb.js"></script></body></html>
