My value comes more from influencing my team&#39;s output than just my own raw technical output. A team lead does not have a mandate to lead a team. Seniority (especially at a company where levels are private) does not confer authority.</p><p>When I first started at Stripe, I founded and led our efficiency engineering team. We were a team of two brand new Stripes with nebulous goals. I struggled to know how we fit into the rest of the infrastructure organization. Without a path laid before us, I did not know how to be heard, how to influence, how to drive strategy.</p><p><a href="http://onemogin.com/about/">Cory</a> taught me about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemawashi"><em>nemawashi</em></a>, a process of slow, deliberate consensus building. By using <em>nemawashi</em> when trying to enact a change, by the time you make the proposal, the change is already <em>de facto</em> implemented because you already have convinced all of the stakeholders that the change is the right thing to do.</p><p>By the end of my second month at Stripe, I had practiced this new skill. Our AWS tooling had a (strong) preference for instance store-backed instance types. Before the introduction of the <code>d</code> instance variants (e.g. <code>c5d</code>, <code>m5d</code>, <code>r5d</code>), this meant using <code>c3</code>, <code>m3</code>, and <code>r3</code> which were ancient even in 2017. I wanted to remove this restriction because new instance families:</p><ul><li>are always faster, better, and cheaper.</li><li>are better supported by OS drivers.</li><li>have bigger reserved instance discounts.</li><li>enable running fewer servers.</li></ul><p>The hurdle to overcome was institutional fear of EBS. There was a large <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/">EBS outage</a> shortly after Stripe started using AWS that formed a lot of organizational scar tissue. To work through this fear, I had <em>a lot</em> of 1:1 conversations across all of infrastructure. I sought to find out:</p><ul><li>Is your team afraid of EBS? Why?</li><li>What instance types would your team like to use if there were no restrictions?</li><li>Do you trust other infrastructure teams to make good instance type choices if we removed the restrictions?</li></ul><p>By having these discussions I learned:</p><ul><li>I had an ally: our Hadoop clusters were using <code>i3</code> instances which have instance storage but are backed by an EBS root volume.</li><li>Most of the reason teams were using legacy instance types was due to inertia.</li><li>The database team was afraid of EBS, but had already ticketed work to address these concerns before moving their workloads.</li></ul><p>I proposed removing the block list for EBS-backed instance types along with a set of recommendations for addressing the specific concerns that I discovered while building consensus. The four line PR was merged without much ceremony.</p><p>I thought <em>nemawashi</em> was only a tool for making progress in the face of nebulous ownership and requirements. <em>nemawashi</em> is how a senior engineer levers up their impact. Building consensus on removing this one block list has had knock on effects two years later:</p><ul><li>The API is more performant.</li><li>Builds are faster.</li><li>The fleet is more efficient.</li><li>The edge network has more capacity.</li><li>Developer VMs are more ergonomic.</li></ul><p>Service owners upgraded their instances on their own. Building consensus and <em>embedding the idea that engineers would use the change to make good decisions for Stripe</em> turned the four line PR into a self-serve strategic initiative.</p><p><em>Nemawashi</em> is a tool for helping the organization do the right thing by default. The goal of a senior engineer should be to identify what those <em>right things</em> are and set the organization up for success by removing roadblocks.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src="/main.00ab8c3169de0b9be2bb.js"></script></body></html>
